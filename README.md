This is a fork of [Magnus Hallin](https://github.com/mhallin)'s awesome 
[GraphQL-Docs](https://github.com/mhallin/graphql-docs).

The following changes have been implemented:
* Implement [Fatih Kadir AkÄ±n](https://github.com/f)'s fix adding support for Union Type
* Group types by definition (Object, Input, Interface, etc.)
* Sort types within each grouping alphabetically
* Add a header for each grouping (with link)
* Add fixed side navigation 
* Misc style changes, like pretty scrollbars :)
